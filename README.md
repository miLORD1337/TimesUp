# TimesUp
A Version of TimesUp! to play via video call with friends and family.

1. Every player creates a .txt named after him- or herself, e.g. 'alice.txt'.
   In this file he/she puts one word each row, as many words as the players choose beforehand. 
   The number of words (and therefore lines) must be equal for each player. 
2. That file is then sent to the hosting player.
3. The hosting player copies the files into the 'files/'-folder and starts the game.
4. A keypress advances game steps, players, rounds, etc..
5. Have fun!
